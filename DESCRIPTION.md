# RealiBuddy TL;DR

**RealiBuddy** is a web-based real-time lie detector that monitors your speech, fact-checks your claims using AI, and delivers electric shocks via a Pavlok wearable device when you make false statements. The system captures audio through your browser microphone, streams it to Deepgram API for sub-300ms speech-to-text conversion, uses Google Gemini API to extract factual claims and verify them against web sources, then triggers the Pavlok API v5 to deliver calibrated electric stimulation (intensity 1-100) when lies are detected with sufficient confidence. The architecture uses WebSocket connections for real-time bidirectional communication between a browser-based frontend and a Node.js/Python backend that orchestrates all external APIs. Safety features include maximum 10 zaps per hour, 5-second cooldowns, and an emergency stop button, with the entire MVP buildable in 10 hours. **Critical verification needed:** Gemini API documentation for model capabilities, web search integration, streaming support, function calling, pricing, rate limits, and structured output specifications must be confirmed via Context7 before implementation to avoid assumptions.
